    <p>
	Born in a small but beautiful himalayan country of Nepal, I love to be at places where the breeze is always cold.
    Currently, I work for <a href="https://www.arista.com/en/">Arista Networks</a> from our 
	<a href="https://www.arista.com/en/careers/india">Bangalore office</a> as a Software Engineer.
	Apart from working at Arista, I like to work on independent projects that can help, in some way or another,
	to boost the digital culture of Nepal.
    My high school and undergrad have given me a lot of opporutnities and I've tried everything from
    <a href=>competitive programming</a> to <a href="/projects">software development for different devices</a>.
	Interested in customer profiling and creation of customer specific services, I love how data
	can be leveraged to get insights for the benefit of all.
    Also, I'm a person who likes to <a href="/hobbies">travel and play</a> a lot.
