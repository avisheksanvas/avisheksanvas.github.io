	  <h2>CLI Configurable MAC Security MKA MAC Address</h2>
      <h1>May 2020 - August 2020</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1AE">MAC Security</a> key agreements between peers
		takes place by the exchange of packets using
		<a href="https://www.vocal.com/secure-communication/eapol-extensible-authentication-protocol-over-lan/#:~:text=Extensible%20Authentication%20Protocol%20(EAP)%20over,on%20to%20access%20network%20resources.">Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPoL)</a>
		as a transport protocol. These packets
		have a dedicated MAC address for them and hence, key agreements between peers that are multiple
		hops ( other switches in between ) away can fail due to intermediate switches considering that
		the packet is destined to them.
		Worked on a <a>team of 2 to urgently provide the customer with a way to configure this MAC address</a>
		which can be particular to peers that are multiple hops away.

	  <h2>Layer 2 Protocol Forwarding</h2>
      <h1>February 2020 - May 2020</h1>
      <p>
		Normally, a switch traps L2 protocol ( LACP/LLDP/STP/MACSec ) frames to CPU.
		However, certain use-cases may require these frames to be forwarded.
		This feature provides a <a>mechanism to control the behavior of L2 protocol frames received on a port</a>.
		This feature was already present for interfaces. Worked <a>single-handedly to increase granularity for this feature</a>,
		as requested by many customers to provide the flexbility to use this feature at a sub-interface level
		where control of forwarding can be provided for different VLANs on the same interface.

	  <h2>Chat BOT integrated with Google Hangouts Chat</h2>
      <h1>ImproveIT Hackathon - October 2019</h1>
      <p>
		Built a <a>chat bot</a> that allows control of development tools through the enterprise chat appliation provided by <a>Google ( GHC )</a>
		as part of Arista's Biannual Hackathon. This bot provides the employees an interface to
		<a>Run/Scheudule/View Test Results</a>, <a>Run/View Builds for projects</a>, etc. using GHC through their mobile,
		when they are away from their office laptop and hence <a>save a lot of time</a>.

	  <h2>Egress MAC Access Control Lists</h2>
      <h1>September 2019 - January 2020</h1>
      <p>
		Worked on a feature to <a>filter packets</a> that go out of a switch based on the <a>MAC address</a> of the packet.
		The feature is known as <a>MAC Access Control Lists</a>.
		This was my first project at Arista in a 2 member team which helped me learn in detail about the development cycle
		at Arista and also get familiar with the technology stack used at Arista for product development,
		testing and version control.

      <h1>June 2020 - Present</h1>
      <p>
		Built a dashboard for current COVID situation in Nepal. The status is shown using a map of Nepal,
		which employees shades of red to show <a>most affected districts</a>. Apart from that a <a>summary</a> for all
		the covid related info is also shown. Also, using the data about which district is affected most,
		it shows the <a>borders with foreign countries that should be tightened.</a>
